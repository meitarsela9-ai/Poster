## Animation Phases (Total: ~2 minutes 15 seconds)

### Phase 1: The Breath (2.5s - 28.0s)
A breathing graphic design poster - rectangle breathes around "Times Language"

- Rectangle fades in (2.5s)
- Inhale: unified expansion of rectangle + text (4.5s)
- Hold breath at peak (3.0s)
- Exhale: unified contraction back to origin (4.5s)
- Release: slow growth to poster edges (7.0s)
- Ghosting: rectangle fades, corner dots remain as anchors (4.0s)

**Implementation**: Rectangle drawn with p5.js primitives (1px stroke), corner dots/handles drawn separately

### Phase 2: The Constellation (28.0s - 40.0s)
Stars flickering on a horizon - tangent dots appear on "2026"

- Dots appear at horizontal/vertical tangent points on 2026
- Asynchronous appearance over 12 seconds
- Each dot has random delay for organic rippling effect
- Creates mesmerizing twinkling

### Phase 3: The Infusion (40.0s - 70.0s)
Slow, creeping density - dots gradually fill all elements

- Dots appear on all elements (2026, Times, Language, address, etc.)
- **Density**: 45% for 2026 (large), 50% for other text (small)
- Completely randomized timing over 30 seconds
- Creates continuous surprise and discovery

### Phase 4: The Bloom (70.0s - 89.0s)
Synchronized expansion - all dots grow together

- **Wait period** (70.0s - 71.0s): All dots fully generated, pause before growth
- **Synchronized growth** (71.0s - 89.0s): All dots grow together in unison (18s)
- **Large bubbles** (2026): grow 13x original size
- **Small bubbles** (other text): grow 5x original size
- Stroke weight scales from 1.2x to 3.5x as dots expand
- Unified bloom effect, peak saturation

### Phase 5: Transformation & Emergence (89.0s+)
Smooth metamorphosis with emergent behavior - the ecosystem reveals itself

#### Visual Transformations (smooth, no popping):
- **Poster fade** (89.0s): Original graphics fade out instantly
- **Blue transformation** (89.0s - 89.5s): 70% of small dots instantly transform white → blue (0.5s)
  - Happens BEFORE dispersion so dots are already colored
  - Blue dots shrink to 25% of small white size
- **Dispersion explosion** (89.0s - 92.0s): All small dots scatter across screen (3s)
- **Snake game starts** (92.0s+): Grid-based movement, eating, and cutting begins
- **Stroke fade** (101.0s - 116.0s):
  - Small dots gradually lose blue outlines (15s)
  - Large white dots keep their outlines permanently
  - Final state: small dots are pure (no strokes), large dots keep strokes
- **Text emerges** (97.0s - 105.0s): Background text layer fades in (8s)

#### Three Distinct Bubble Sizes:
1. **Large white bubbles** (from 2026): Always stay white, lose stroke
2. **Small white bubbles** (from other text): 30% stay white, lose stroke
3. **Tiny blue dots** (from other text): 70% transform to blue, lose stroke

#### Emergent Behavior - Dot Personalities:
Each dot assigned personality at Phase 5 start (like Conway's Game of Life):

- **15% Leaders** (1.8x speed): Move fast, ignore others, blaze trails
- **30% Followers** (1.0x speed): Attracted to nearby leaders, create streams
- **20% Loners** (1.2x speed): Repelled when crowded (>8 neighbors), prevent blobs
- **35% Wanderers** (0.9x speed): Ignore everyone, drift randomly

**Result**: Organic trails, dynamic groupings, dots with "life" - no concentric circles

#### Small Dot Snake Game:
All small dots (both white and blue) use grid-based Markov walks with eating and cutting mechanics:

- **Initial explosion/dispersion** (first 3 seconds of Phase 5):
  - All small dots disperse across screen with fast Brownian motion (2x speed)
  - Spreads dots out before snake game begins
- **Who**: Small white dots (30%) + Small blue dots (70% transform from white)
  - Blue dots smoothly transform from white during Phase 5 (not created separately)
  - Total small dot count remains constant - blue replaces white, doesn't add to it
- **Grid-based Markov walk**: Dots move in discrete steps on a grid (8px cells)
- **4-directional movement**: Only up, down, left, right (like classic snake game)
- **Random direction changes**: 15% chance to change direction each step
- **Snake eating**: When two snake heads collide (any color), the larger eats the smaller
  - Eaten snake becomes body segments following the eater
  - White snakes can eat blue snakes and vice versa
  - Snakes grow by eating other snakes
  - **Proper chain following**: Each segment follows the one ahead (creates long snakes)
- **Snake cutting**: When a snake head collides with another snake's body, it cuts that snake
  - The body segment becomes a new independent snake head
  - Creates dynamic splitting and reformation
- **Step interval**: 0.15 seconds between moves (speed of snake movement)
- **Large white dots**: Only large dots (from 2026) use much faster, fluid Brownian motion (1.2 speed, 0.95 damping)
  - Always keep their blue outlines (never fade)
  - Always rendered on top of small dots and text

#### Floating Text Layer:
Background text broken into 1-4 character chunks, randomly scattered across canvas:

- **Random positioning**: Chunks placed randomly across entire screen (not at original Figma positions)
- Text rendered **at bottom layer** (underneath all dots)
- Sometimes hidden when bubbles pass over
- Creates layered depth effect with fragmented, scattered text
- Chunks drift independently with fluid Brownian motion (0.8 speed, 0.96 damping)
- **Rendering order**: Text (bottom) → Small dots (middle) → Large dots (top)

};

// Dot density
const FILL_TARGET = 0.45;           // 45% fill for 2026 (large bubbles)
const FILL_TARGET_SMALL = 0.5;      // 50% fill for small text
const TANGENT_DOT_RADIUS = 3;       // Same as fill dots (uniform size)
const FILL_DOT_RADIUS = 3;

// Dot growth
const DOT_GROW_2026 = 13;           // Large bubbles grow 13x
const DOT_GROW_OTHER = 5;           // Small bubbles grow 5x
const STROKE_GROW_MAX = 3.5;        // Stroke grows 3.5x at peak

// Transformation
const BLUE_DOT_PERCENTAGE = 0.7;    // 70% of small dots turn blue
const BLUE_DOT_SHRINK_OTHER = 0.25; // Blue dots shrink to 25% of small white

// Emergent behavior

const BLUE_EATING_DISTANCE = 12;    // Distance for eating another snake
const BLUE_CUTTING_DISTANCE = 8;    // Distance for cutting a snake
```

## Sampling Strategy (for performance & aesthetics)

```javascript
// Edge sampling spacing (pixels between dots)
allEdges.numbers2026 = sampleEdges(..., 15);      // Moderate spacing for dense coverage
allEdges.times = sampleEdges(..., 4);             // Tight spacing for high density
allEdges.language = sampleEdges(..., 4);
allEdges.address = sampleEdges(..., 4);
allEdges.topBlock = sampleEdges(..., 4);
allEdges.bottomLeft = sampleEdges(..., 4);

// Tangent detection
const spacing = 15;  // Check every 15 pixels (moderate tangent dot density)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Edge Detection
```javascript
const EDGE_THRESHOLDS = {
  numbers2026: { solid: 200, empty: 180 },  // High threshold for glow
  times:       { solid: 128, empty: 100 },
  language:    { solid: 128, empty: 100 },
  // ...
};
```

### Key Features
1. **Phase 1 Rectangle**: p5.js primitives, corner dots stay circular during scaling
2. **Dynamic Text Rendering**: Times/Language rendered every frame for smooth scaling
3. **Edge Tracing**: Scans image pixels for alpha transitions
4. **Asynchronous Appearance**: Each dot has individual `delay` property
5. **Synchronous Growth**: All dots grow together in unison (no individual delays)
6. **Smooth Transformations**: Color interpolation (white → blue), no popping
7. **Personality System**: Each dot assigned personality for emergent behavior
8. **Screen Wrapping**: Dots wrap around edges for freedom of movement
9. **Floating Text Chunks**: Background text broken into 1-4 character chunks, randomly scattered across screen, rendered beneath bubbles

### Dot Properties
Each dot tracks:
- `x, y` - Position
- `r` - Radius
- `opacity` - Visibility (0-1)
- `delay` - Appearance delay (Phase 2/3)
- `growthDelay` - Growth delay (Phase 4)
- `scale` - Individual scale factor
- `fate` - 'foam' (white) or 'residue' (blue)
- `isLarge` - true for 2026 dots, false for others
- `transformProgress` - Color transition progress (0-1)
- `strokeOpacity` - Stroke visibility (0-1)
- `personality` - 'leader', 'follower', 'loner', 'wanderer'
- `speedMultiplier` - Movement speed multiplier
- `vx, vy` - Velocity (Phase 5)

## Figma Integration

The project includes tools to analyze Figma frames:

```bash
cd tools
node inspect-frames.mjs       # List all frames
node analyze-frames-10-13.mjs # Analyze frames 10-13 in detail
node extract-text.mjs         # Extract text positions
```

## Design Philosophy

**Pacing**: Consistent, captivating rhythm throughout (~2m 15s total)
- No jarring fast sections
- Each phase unfolds at a mesmerizing pace
- Longer durations allow appreciation of transformations

**Visual Hierarchy**: Three clear bubble sizes
- Large white (imposing presence)
- Small white (supporting layer)
- Tiny blue (detail/texture)

**Emergence**: Simple personality rules create complex patterns
- No concentric circles or uniform blobs
- Organic trails and dynamic groupings
- Dots with "life" - temporary formations that form and dissolve

**Smooth Transitions**: Everything transforms gradually
- No popping or disappearing
- Color interpolation (not sudden switches)
- Stroke fades applied to all dots uniformly

## Security
- API keys stored in `.env` file (NOT committed to git)
- `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and sensitive files
