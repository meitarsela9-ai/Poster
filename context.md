I'll build this systematically. Let me create the new animation system.Done! To use: rename `sketch-v2.js` to `sketch.js` (or update `index.html` to reference `sketch-v2.js`).

## Animation Phases

### Phase 1: Rectangle Animation (2.5s - 27.0s)
- Blue rectangle with corner dots/handles fades in around "Times Language" (2s)
- Rectangle expands outward uniformly (1.2x scale, 3.5s)
- Text scales up to 1.15x (3s)
- Hold at expanded state (2s)
- Text shrinks back to normal (3s)
- Rectangle shrinks back to initial size (3.5s)
- **Rectangle grows to fit poster edges** (with 20px margin, 5s) - slowly and deliberately
- Rectangle lines fade out (2.5s), **corner dots remain visible**
- **Implementation**: Rectangle drawn with p5.js primitives (consistent 1px stroke), corner dots/handles drawn separately to stay circular during non-uniform scaling
- **Note**: Times/Language are rendered dynamically (not in poster layer) to allow smooth scaling

### Phase 2: Tangent Dots (27.0s - 35.0s)
- Dots appear at points on "2026" where edges are straight (horizontal/vertical tangents)
- **Asynchronous appearance**: Each dot has random delay, creating organic rippling effect (8s total)
- Entrancing, meditative pace

### Phase 3: Gradual Fill (35.0s - 60.0s)
- Dots gradually appear on all elements (2026, Times, Language, address, top, bottom)
- Fills to 42% density (reduced by 30% from original 60%)
- **Completely randomized timing**: Dots appear organically with no predictable pattern (25s)
- Creates continuous surprise and discovery

### Phase 4: Dot Growth (60.0s - 72.0s)
- **Asynchronous growth**: Each individual dot grows at its own pace with random delays
- **All dots grow uniformly at this stage**:
  - 2026 dots (tangent + fill) grow 11x their original size
  - Other dots (times, language, address, top, bottom) grow 4x their original size
- Blue borders (stroke) grow from 1x to 2x thickness as dots expand
- Wave-like effect as different dots reach full size at different times (12s)

### Phase 5: Transformation and Brownian Motion (72.0s+)
- **Text Fade Out** (72.0s - 75.0s): Original text/graphics fade out slowly (3s)
- **Dot Transformation** (75.0s - 80.0s): 30% of dots transform over 5 seconds
  - **Fate Assignment**: At start of Phase 5, each dot randomly assigned one of two fates:
    - 70% stay white (white fill, blue stroke)
    - 30% transform to blue (gradually change from white to blue fill, stroke fades out)
  - **Asynchronous transformation**: Each transforming dot has individual delay for organic wave-like effect
  - **Shrinking**: As dots turn blue, they shrink:
    - 2026 blue dots shrink to 40% of their grown size
    - Other blue dots shrink to 50% of their grown size
  - **Color transition**: Dots smoothly interpolate from white to blue fill, stroke fades out
- **Brownian Motion** (80.0s - 100.0s): Dots float and move organically
  - 2026 dots move toward 5 blob centers with Brownian motion
  - Other dots drift freely with gentle Brownian motion
  - Very slow, organic movement (20s)

## Key Configuration (top of sketch.js)

```javascript
const TIMELINE = {
  phase1Start: 2.5,
  rectForm: 2.0,          // Slower, more deliberate
  rectGrow: 3.5,
  textGrow: 3.0,
  holdExpanded: 2.0,
  textShrink: 3.0,
  rectShrink: 3.5,
  rectGrowToPoster: 5.0,  // Very slow growth to poster edges
  rectFade: 2.5,          // Slow fade
  phase2Start: 27.0,      // After phase 1 completes
  tangentAppear: 8.0,     // Very slow asynchronous appearance
  phase3Start: 35.0,      // 27.0 + 8.0
  gradualFill: 25.0,      // Very slow, entrancing fill
  phase4Start: 60.0,      // 35.0 + 25.0
  dotsGrow: 12.0,         // Slow asynchronous growth
  phase5Start: 72.0,      // 60.0 + 12.0
  textFadeOut: 3.0,       // Text fades out
  dotTransform: 5.0,      // Dots transform to blue/shrink
  blobForm: 20.0,         // Blob formation
  holdFinal: 10.0
};

const RECT_PADDING = 30;              // Padding around Times/Language (prevents dot overlap)
const RECT_GROW_SCALE = 1.2;          // Rectangle uniform expansion multiplier
const TEXT_GROW_SCALE = 1.15;         // Text expansion (smaller than rectangle)
const RECT_POSTER_MARGIN = 20;        // Margin from poster edges in final position
const FILL_TARGET = 0.42;             // 42% edge fill (reduced by 30%)
const TANGENT_THRESHOLD = 0.15;       // Lower = more tangent points
const DOT_GROW_2026 = 11;             // 2026 white dots grow 11x
const DOT_GROW_OTHER = 4;             // Other white dots grow 4x
const BLUE_DOT_PERCENTAGE = 0.3;      // 30% of dots turn blue and shrink
const BLUE_DOT_SHRINK_2026 = 0.4;     // Blue 2026 dots are 40% size of white dots
const BLUE_DOT_SHRINK_OTHER = 0.5;    // Blue other dots are 50% size of white dots
const rectFadeOutEnabled = true;      // Rectangle lines fade out, dots stay visible
```

## Edge Detection Thresholds
For images with glow/blur (like 2026.png), use higher thresholds:
```javascript
const EDGE_THRESHOLDS = {
  numbers2026: { solid: 200, empty: 180 },  // High = ignores glow
  times:       { solid: 128, empty: 100 },
  // ...
};
```

## Technical Notes

1. **Phase 1 Rectangle**: Drawn with p5.js `rect()` primitives (not SVG) for consistent 1px stroke during non-uniform scaling. Corner dots and handles drawn separately to stay circular. Rectangle animates from initial bounds around Times/Language to poster edges (with margin). Rectangle lines fade out while corner dots remain visible.
2. **Dynamic Text Rendering**: Times/Language are NOT in poster layer - rendered every frame with transform scaling for smooth animation
3. **Edge Tracing**: Scans image pixels, finds where alpha transitions from solid to transparent
4. **Tangent Detection**: Analyzes local edge direction, selects points where edge is mostly horizontal or vertical
5. **Sampling**: Grid-based sampling ensures even dot distribution
6. **Asynchronous Dot Appearance**: Each dot has individual random `delay` property (0-1). Dots appear organically over extended periods creating continuous surprise.
7. **Asynchronous Dot Growth**: Each dot has individual `scale` and `growthDelay` properties. Dots grow at their own pace creating wave-like patterns. All 2026 dots grow 11x, all other dots grow 4x. Stroke weight scales from 1x to 2x as dots grow.
8. **Dot Fate Assignment**: At start of Phase 5, each dot randomly assigned a `fate` property: 70% stay 'white', 30% become 'blueSmall'. Each transforming dot gets random `transformDelay` for asynchronous transformation.
9. **Dot Transformation**: During Phase 5 (after text fade), 30% of dots gradually transform over 5s: fill color interpolates from white to blue, stroke fades out, size shrinks (2026 dots to 40%, other dots to 50% of grown size). Each dot transforms at its own pace based on `transformDelay`.
10. **Phase 5 Blob Formation**: After transformation, 2026 dots move toward 5 blob centers with attraction force and Brownian motion. Other dots drift freely. Final state: 70% white dots (no stroke after posterOpacity=0), 30% smaller blue dots (solid blue, no stroke).
11. **Animation Timing**: Slow, entrancing pace designed to mesmerize viewers. Total runtime: ~110 seconds (~1 minute 50 seconds)

## How to Run
```bash
cd p5js
npx serve .
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## Figma Integration (Optional)
Tools in `/tools/` folder can extract dot coordinates from Figma:
- `extract-final.mjs` - Extracts circles from Figma file
- Uses environment variables from `.env` for credentials (see Environment Variables section)
- Install dotenv: `npm install dotenv`
- Run: `node tools/extract-final.mjs`

## Security
- API keys are stored in `.env` file (NOT committed to git)
- `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and sensitive files
