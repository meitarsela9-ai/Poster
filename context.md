# TIMES LANGUAGE 2026 - ANIMATED POSTER

## Project Overview
Animated poster for "Times Language 2026" exhibition. Eleven-phase animation system built in p5.js with dynamic dot growth, smooth transformations, and emergent behavior patterns. Features dual movement systems: Brownian motion with attraction points for large dots, and grid-based snake game mechanics for small dots.

## Animation Phases (Total: ~2 minutes / 116 seconds)

The animation is divided into 11 distinct phases, each with specific behaviors and visual effects:

### Phase 1: The Breath (2.5s - 28.0s)
A breathing graphic design poster - rectangle breathes around "Times Language"

- **Rectangle fade-in** (2.5s): Rectangle appears around text
- **Inhale** (4.5s): Unified expansion of rectangle + text
- **Hold** (3.0s): Pause at peak inflation
- **Exhale** (4.5s): Unified contraction back to origin
- **Release** (7.0s): Slow growth to poster edges, locking into place
- **Ghosting** (4.0s): Rectangle fades, corner dots remain as anchors

**Implementation**: Rectangle drawn with p5.js primitives (1px stroke), corner dots/handles drawn separately

### Phase 2: The Constellation (28.0s - 40.0s)
Stars flickering on a horizon - tangent dots twinkle on "2026"

- Dots appear at horizontal/vertical tangent points on 2026
- Asynchronous appearance over 12 seconds
- Each dot has random delay for organic rippling effect
- Twinkling effect creates mesmerizing star-like appearance

### Phase 3: The Infusion (40.0s - 70.0s)
Slow, creeping density - dots gradually fill all elements

- Dots sprinkle onto all elements (2026, Times, Language, address, etc.)
- **Density**: 15% for 2026 (large), 20% for other text (small)
- Completely randomized timing over 30 seconds
- Creates continuous surprise and discovery like rain on pavement

### Phase 4: The Bloom (70.0s - 89.0s)
Synchronized expansion - all dots grow together

- **Wait period** (70.0s - 71.0s): All dots fully generated, pause before growth
- **Synchronized growth** (71.0s - 89.0s): All dots expand in unison (18s)
- **Large bubbles** (2026): grow 13x original size
- **Small bubbles** (other text): grow 5x original size
- Stroke weight scales from 1.2x to 3.5x as dots expand
- Exponential easing creates dramatic "pop" effect

### Phase 5: The Dispersion (89.0s - 92.0s)
Initial explosion scatters all dots across the canvas

- **Poster fade**: Original graphics fade out immediately
- **Fast Brownian explosion**: All dots (large and small) scatter with 20x speed
- **Duration**: 3 seconds of rapid dispersion
- **Purpose**: Spreads dots across entire canvas before specialized behaviors begin
- Creates dramatic explosive "scatter bomb" effect

### Phase 6: The Transformation (89.0s - 89.5s)
Small dots undergo color transformation (overlaps with Phase 5)

- **Blue transformation**: 70% of small dots transform white → blue (0.5s)
- Happens during dispersion so dots are colored while scattering
- **Size change**: Blue dots shrink to 25% of small white size
- **Large bubbles** (2026): Always stay white
- **Small bubbles** (other text): 30% stay white, 70% turn blue

### Phase 7: The Float (92.0s onwards)
Large dots drift with Brownian motion and attraction points

- **5 Attraction Points**: Scattered across canvas creating natural clustering
- **Gentle attraction**: Dots pulled toward nearest point (0.03 strength)
- **Brownian motion**: Random, jittery movement (0.15 speed for large dots)
- **Frequent gusts**: Strong random forces (5.0 strength, 40% frequency)
- **Minimum distance**: Dots stop at half radius from attraction points
- **Individual variation**: Random speed multipliers (0.7x - 1.3x)
- **Medium damping** (0.97): Natural deceleration
- Creates gentle, jittery floating with organic clustering

### Phase 8: The Resurfacing (97.0s - 105.0s)
Background text emerges from grey space

- Text chunks fade in over 8 seconds
- Asynchronous appearance with individual delays
- **Text format**: 1-4 character chunks randomly positioned
- Text rendered at **bottom layer** (underneath all dots)
- Chunks drift with fluid Brownian motion (0.8 speed, 0.96 damping)
- Creates layered depth effect with fragmented, scattered text

### Phase 9: The Fade (101.0s - 116.0s)
Stroke outlines gradually disappear from small dots

- **Small dots**: Blue outlines fade over 15 seconds
- **Large white dots**: Keep their blue outlines permanently
- **Final state**: Small dots are pure (no strokes), large dots retain strokes
- Creates visual separation between large and small elements

### Phase 10: The Snake Game (92.0s onwards)
Small dots follow grid-based movement with eating and cutting mechanics (overlaps with Phase 7)

- **Who**: ALL small dots (both white 30% and blue 70%)
- **Grid-based Markov walk**: Discrete 4-directional movement (8px cells)
- **Direction changes**: 15% probability each step
- **Snake eating**: Larger snakes eat smaller ones on head collision
  - Eaten snake becomes body segments
  - Creates chain-following behavior
- **Snake cutting**: Head colliding with body cuts the snake
  - Body segment becomes new independent head
  - Dynamic splitting and reformation
- **Step interval**: 0.15 seconds between moves
- White and blue snakes can eat each other

### Phase 11: The Ecosystem (116.0s onwards)
Final stable state - all systems running in harmony

- All behaviors continue indefinitely
- **Large dots**: Float with attraction points and Brownian motion
- **Small dots**: Continue snake game mechanics
- **Text**: Drifts in background layer
- System reaches equilibrium with all elements coexisting

## Three Distinct Bubble Sizes

1. **Large white bubbles** (from 2026): Always stay white, keep strokes permanently
2. **Small white bubbles** (30% of other text): Stay white, lose strokes
3. **Tiny blue dots** (70% of other text): Transform to blue, lose strokes

## Rendering Order (bottom to top)

1. **Text layer** (bottom): Floating word chunks
2. **Small dots** (middle): White and blue small bubbles
3. **Large dots** (top): Large white bubbles from 2026

```

const TEXT_SIZE_SCALE = 1.0;        // Scale factor for floating text size (0.3x - 3.0x)
```

## Sampling Strategy (for performance & aesthetics)

```javascript
// Edge sampling spacing (pixels between dots)
allEdges.numbers2026 = sampleEdges(..., 25);      // Moderate spacing (configurable)
allEdges.times = sampleEdges(..., 6);             // Tight spacing (configurable)
allEdges.language = sampleEdges(..., 6);
allEdges.address = sampleEdges(..., 6);
allEdges.topBlock = sampleEdges(..., 6);
allEdges.bottomLeft = sampleEdges(..., 6);

// Tangent detection (Phase 2)
const TANGENT_SPACING = 25;  // Check every 25 pixels (configurable via interactive)
const TANGENT_THRESHOLD = 0.15;  // Edge straightness threshold (configurable)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Edge Detection
```javascript
const EDGE_THRESHOLDS = {
  numbers2026: { solid: 200, empty: 180 },  // High threshold for glow
  times:       { solid: 128, empty: 100 },
  language:    { solid: 128, empty: 100 },
  // ...
};
```

node extract-text.mjs         # Extract text positions
```

## Design Philosophy

**Pacing**: Consistent, captivating rhythm throughout (~2 minutes total)
- 11 distinct phases with clear transitions
- Each phase unfolds at a mesmerizing pace
- Overlapping phases create continuous evolution
- Longer durations allow appreciation of transformations

**Visual Hierarchy**: Three clear bubble sizes
- Large white (imposing presence)
- Small white (supporting layer)
- Tiny blue (detail/texture)

**Organic Movement**: Natural floating with multiple behavior systems creates dynamic patterns
- **Large dots**: Brownian motion with attraction to 5 focal points
- **Small dots**: Grid-based snake game with eating and cutting mechanics
- Individual speed variation creates natural diversity (0.7x - 1.3x)
- Frequent gusts keep movement dynamic and prevent stagnation
- Emergent complexity from simple rules

**Smooth Transitions**: Everything transforms gradually
- No popping or disappearing
- Color interpolation (not sudden switches)
- Stroke fades applied to all dots uniformly

## Security
- API keys stored in `.env` file (NOT committed to git)
- `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and sensitive files
